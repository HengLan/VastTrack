# VastTrack: Vast Category Visual Object Tracking

<img src="https://github.com/HengLan/VastTrack/blob/main/assets/VastTrack.png" width="110%">

**Figure:** We introduce [**VastTrack**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03493), a new large-scale benchmark that aims to facilitate general single object tracking with abundant object categories (over **2.1K classes**) and videos (**over 50K sequences**). Here display partial target trajectory in a video. <em>Please notice that, only a very small part of categories and videos are demonstrated</em>.

For each video in VastTrack, we provide bounding box annotations, complete occlusion and out-of-view labels, as well as linguistic descriptions. The format of the bounding box is as follows: [x, y, width, height]. (Our training set is divided into 82 parts of compressed packages, with the category corresponding to each compressed package specified in a JSON file.) The test set consists of 15 parts of compressed packages.
